Project HackAthon Practicum 2022

## Description üîç

In Latin America it is well known that people are very happy, but the harsh reality is that despite all that energy and good vibes, a very strong stigma is hidden, which is that of mental health. For most it is a taboo and even something forbidden!
Today we are aware that accepting that one is not perfect and has a world inside is the first step in a process of acceptance and healing that involves mental health. moody. It was born as a friendly alternative for all people who want to take that first step.

Moody is a platform where users can listen to mental health podcasts. The content is available to those seeking guidance from professionals who specialize in treating mental health issues and is also intended to assist those struggling with or seeking information on mental health issues. Our live sessions and podcasts provide insight, support, and guidance from professionals.


## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

1.JavaScript
   - `EventListeners` are implemented to perform certain actions based on events.
   - We use `Arrow Functions` to add logic in adding and removing classes, optimizing and keeping the code short and readable.
   - `QuerySelector` to select specific elements of the DOM.
   - `classList.add` and `classList.remove` to add and remove classes respectively.
2. Responsive Design
   - The website has been developed following a mobile first approach.
   - The website is designed to scale smoothly in:
     - 1280px and above (standard and above laptops).
     - From 1024px to 1280px (from a horizontal tablet to a standard laptop).
     - From 768px to 1024px (from a vertical tablet to a horizontal tablet).
     - From 425px to 768px (from a large smartphone to a vertical tablet).
     - Up to 425px (mobile devices).
3. CCS Grid
4.CCS Flexbox
5. BEM - Block, Element, Modifier
6. Git - While this is invisible to the user, a major addition to this project was the use of a development branch with multiple branches with features implemented in the home page build. When the page is live, work can still be done and committed in parts without disturbing the live version of the page. Using branches in this way is real world development.

## Future improvements üíé

- Save user information in a database for future reference after page refresh.
- Allow user authentication.
- Allow the user to create cards-tips.
- Add functionality to the `see more` buttons as they interact with the Section class to add more elements of `JavaScript` objects.
- Complete the Collapsible Cards, make them expand. Add them as a class and create an object that contains them.
- Create a podcasts class, so you can also add them with `JavaScript` to the markup and make it easier to enter or change podcasts with a function.
- Filter the podcasts according to the tags selected by the user.
